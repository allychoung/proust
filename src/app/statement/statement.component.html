<p>This website documents my memories and experiences as an undergraduate student in Northeastern's English program. During our Literature and Memory capstone seminar, my peers and I read and discussed Marcel Proust's Swann's Way, the first volume of his lifetime's work In Search of Lost Time. With the help of the theoretical framework provided in Joshua Landy's The World According to Proust, we examined Proust's writing style, his connection to art, and how memory operates within the narrative of Swann's Way. I was particularly interested in Landy's idea of a kaleidoscopic view of the self--how one's past selves, both in the spatial and temporal sense, merge to form a singular fractured image.

<p>    I will reflect on my experiences, both the academic and the personal, over the last four years, using a Proustian framework of memory to narrate my college life. Throughout this project I take a look at what I have written over the past few years, from scholarly papers to presentation slides to poetry, and assess the overall development of my writing. I also include various works I have read that have had a lasting impact on me.

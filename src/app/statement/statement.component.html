    <h1 class="white text-centered">Introduction</h1>
    <p>This website documents my memories and experiences as an undergraduate student in Northeastern's English program. During our Literature and Memory capstone seminar, my peers and I read and discussed Marcel Proust's <em>Swann's Way</em>, the first volume of his lifetime's work <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>. With the help of the theoretical framework provided in Joshua Landy's <em>The World According to Proust</em>, we examined Proust's writing style, his connection to art, and how memory operates within the narrative of <em>Swann's Way</em>. I was particularly interested in Landy's idea of a kaleidoscopic view of the self--how one's past selves, both in the spatial and temporal sense, merge to form a singular fractured image.

    <p>    I will reflect on my experiences, both the academic and the personal, over the last four years, using a Proustian framework of memory to narrate my college life. Throughout this project I take a look at what I have written over the past few years, from scholarly papers to poetry, and assess the overall development of my writing. I also include various works read throughout this course and those that have had a lasting impact on me.

        A website format suits this project because of the unique features of the digital medium. I utilize hyperlinks to direct users directly to my cited works. I have panes of text that enforce user scrolling, creating the feel of a vignette, and I include some animations to create a more immersive experience with the text of the website. Parts of the project are divided into discrete webpages, and each webpage is further broken down into color-coded sections, alternating between narrative voice and past works I have written throughout my college experience. Reading through the works of writing I have done throughout the past four years, along with the literary works I have read for both coursework and for leisure, has made me emotional at times. This was a nice way to reflect on all that I have accomplished and learned over the years.

        <p>I felt like I had been sleeping for a year. For months I rested under my parents’ roof, and as the days began to melt into one another, a haze began to cloud my mind, and I found myself in bed, lying still. Recalling this period in my life always comes with a nauseating sweetness--the sinking of the mattress, the slant of light peering through the curtains, fine layers of dust. Through the window, across the street, I could see the neighbors roaming indoors. I looked down to a street full of cars, parked and motionless except for the swarm of delivery trucks driving by every day. </p>
        <p>People did not go outside, and when they did, they did so out of necessity. We wrapped scarves around our mouths before heading out the door, and when I returned home, the TV would be on. The TV was always on, and the reality it presented felt far more tangible than what I saw walking outside. The world had halted, and Time continued indifferently. </p>

                <p class="red">In my first semester of college, we read Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Masque of the Red Death.” The story follows Prince Prospero, who, in response to some sort of plague, hosts a lavish party with thousands of friends. The event goes on for months, and as the rest of the world withers, Prospero exchanges champagne glasses and pleasant smiles with the masked faces of his guests. His manor is divided into seven chambers, each lit in a different colored hue. Prospero is in the Blue Room when the mummer comes along. The mummer is another partygoer, clad in drab clothing. He moves uninterrupted through the crowds of guests, until Prospero confronts him. Gasps peal through the air as Prospero attempts to unmask the mummer, only to reveal no tangible form underneath. <em>And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all</em> (Poe 5).</p>
                <p class="red"><em>Certainly a resonant message given our current times</em>, my professor notes. I look back to my laptop screen, where everyone is confined to little digital boxes. I trace a path going through them all like Prospero’s chambers. </p>

                <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> opens with the narrator in a hazy state of mind, one that lies on the boundary between reality and dream. He comes to believe that the book he reads in bed is somehow about him, and, in opening his mind to this idea, enters its darkness. The narrator experiences a series of sensations, the sound of “whistling of trains,” the sound of the “organic creak of the woodwork,” and the sight of a “kaleidoscope of darkness” in the moments before he falls asleep (Proust 3-4). Proust develops an understanding of time and its passage as a deeply sensory and visceral experience, removed altogether from any socially informed conventions of time and its measurement. Life during the COVID-19 pandemic resembled this strange, dream-like state. The darkness the narrator encounters resembles the darkness I felt at home, borne from a lack of stimulation and interaction with the outside world, a sensory deprivation that invited this deeply introspective realm of thought to expand within my quarantined mind. This darkness stirred within me both terror and awe.

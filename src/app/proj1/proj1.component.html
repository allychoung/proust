        <p>I felt like I had been sleeping for a year. For months I rested under my parentsâ€™ roof, and as the days began to melt into one another, a haze began to cloud my mind, and I found myself in bed, lying still. Recalling this period in my life always comes with a nauseating sweetness--the sinking of the mattress, the slant of light peering through the curtains, fine layers of dust. Through the window, across the street, I could see the neighbors roaming indoors. I looked down to a street full of cars, parked and motionless, save for the swarm of delivery trucks driving by every day. </p>

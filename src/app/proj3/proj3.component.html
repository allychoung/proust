                As a child I would draw on pages of printer paper with crayons and markers. For the pieces I was especially proud of, I would tape them to my bedroom wall. In my earliest recollections of my life, my bedroom walls were a light shade of pink, then my mother painted them green, and, finally, I painted them in light gray before heading off to college. As the walls shifted in color, I felt a part of me disappear, the youthful spirit in me that would tack my projects to the wall with a grin, and I resolved to find a means of restoring that light within me.  I sought to produce a work that I deemed worthy of being framed on my bedroom wall.

                        I read this piece aloud during a workshop session in my Poetry Workshop course. I read it a second time. This piece was written during an activity for the same class, in which we wrote lines on strips of paper and then scrambled them in a hat. We then wrote poems while inspired by each other’s lines, slowly piecing together a coherent poem as we wrote. Having the opportunity to share my piece was a cathartic moment for me--My peers expressed interest in my work and the strange, elusive language of my poem, and my poem was the very outcome of my peers’ snippets of writing. I felt the cadence of their discussion, an exchange of ideas working towards a shared understanding. While listening to their discussion, I scrawled down the question in my notebook, “Would specificity in the speaker’s identity and their circumstances further engage a reader and paint a more concise image of womanhood, or is there more meaning in abstracting and depersonalizing the language?” I loved the idea of creating something and seeing others’ reactions. I saw others’ judgments of my writing as no longer a verdict on my competence as a writer, but as a window into a new world of knowledge, one where I could facilitate certain discussions and glean a deeper look into others’ inner selves.

                        I workshopped this poem with the Creative Writing Group run through Northeastern’s Writing Center. I joined the group after being encouraged to join by one of my English professors. The group members thoroughly enjoyed my writing, again citing its “elusive” quality. It occurred to me that this was becoming a staple of my writing--an evasiveness, a voice that emerges and then retreats into the confines of the text. Did this reflect the quality of my own voice, disappearing as suddenly as it arises?                    </p>

                <em>Swann’s Way</em> offered a brief glimpse into the narrator’s writing journey. One of his earliest recollections of writing during childhood is him writing about the steeples he passes on a carriage ride to Martinville. The steeples, one of the many recurring motifs in the volume, are compared to three maidens, and after writing up a short prose-poem about this unique image, he sings with joy.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Landy analyzes the steeples as the artist finding his inner self, getting to the core of his own individual artistic expression: “What the prose poem captures is not some objective (or “intersubjective”) truth about steeples but instead the way they appear to a specific individual” (Landy 20). The narrator’s unique perception of the steeples becomes a key component to his own language, a marker of his emerging individual writerly style. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>What do my steeples look like</em>, I asked myself. Perhaps they lie in the nondescript quality of my own language--the voice in my poetry always describes and implores in a vague, suggestive way. I seemed to be pursuing a voice with no distinct face.

            In “To S.M., an African Painter, On Seeing His Works,” Wheatley ponders the capabilities and privileges of the artist, depicting the conception, execution, and viewing of art as a dynamic process. To Wheatley, Scipio Moorhead’s art takes on a lifelike form, “living” and “breathing” (2, 4). Rather than view art as a static concept, there is a performance and process to it, value that comes from its creation and viewing, beginning from the desire within the “laboring bosom” of the artist to show its “deep intent” (1), to the use of the artist’s tools, in this case being Moorhead’s pencil and paints, in imbuing spirit and life into the work itself, to Wheatley’s own spiritual interaction with the work as it “rush[es] on [her] sight” (6). Wheatley develops the idea that there is an involvement and “labor” on the artist’s part in conceiving of art and transcribing ideas through physical mediums. This labor and dynamism apply to viewers of art as well, as the viewer absorbs, interprets, and derives meaning from the artist’s living creation. The visual and kinesthetic sensations Wheatley details form a link between the work of the artist and his art to the natural world.

        <p>        As much as art’s value comes from the interaction with and labor of creation, Wheatley believes that the artist and the scholar benefit from the permanence and immortality to be found in creating art and in studying the world. We see this demonstrated in Wheatley’s encouragement of Scipio when she addresses him to “fix [his] ardent view” on “deathless glories” (“To S.M.,” 8) and the “footsteps to immortal fame” (12). Creating art, through these images, becomes a rite of passage, fundamentally tied to art’s connection with the “seraphic” (11). A divine rite is granted to scholars as well, as seen in “To the University of Cambridge”: “Students, to you ‘tis given to scan the heights / Above, to traverse the ethereal space” (7-8), where scholarship is defined as a surveying of the “ethereal” and the “heights” of the heavens.  Wheatley views scholarship and art as work of the greatest spiritual order, demonstrated through her wording of the artist as being “exalted to survey / That splendid city” (“To S.M.,” 15-16). The word “exalted” defines artistic pursuits as granting the artist a divine and extraordinary privilege. Wheatley asserts there is pride and boundless joy in being an artist, as she turns to a view of heaven, describing it as a place within the artist’s reach, as the artist can “raise [his] wishful eyes” to it (14). She proposes the idea of heaven within the view and the grasp of the artist as both a privilege and an ultimate motivation in the life of the artist. We begin to see a duality emerge, where the scholar and the artist receive praise and recognition for their efforts, which are associated with graceful movement and a dynamic quality, and yet Wheatley reminds these scholars, and herself, of the obligation to the greater underlying motivation behind such practices—the ability to contact and seek a place within the heavens.
